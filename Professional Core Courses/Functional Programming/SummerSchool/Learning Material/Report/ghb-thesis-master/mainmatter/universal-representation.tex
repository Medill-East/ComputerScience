\chapter{Universal Representation}
\labelChapter{universal-representation}

This chapter introduces a new representation used for modeling \glspl{function}
and \glspl{instruction}.
%
Based on the conclusions drawn in
\refChapter{existing-isel-techniques-and-reps}, we begin in
\refSection{uni-rep-design-requirements} with listing the design requirements
that must be fulfilled by a graph-based representation.
%
From these requirements, in \refSection{uni-rep-program-rep} we design such a
representation, called \gls!{universal representation}, and describe how it is
used for modeling \glspl{function}.
%
We then do the same for \glspl{instruction} in \refSection{uni-rep-instr-rep}.
%
In \refSection{uni-rep-pattern-matching}, we describe how to perform
\gls{pattern matching} using the \gls{universal representation}.
%
In \refSection{uni-rep-ir-comparison}, we compare \gls{universal representation}
with other, existing \glspl{sea-of-nodes IR}.
%
Lastly, a summary is given in \refSection{uni-rep-summary}.


\section{Design Requirements}
\labelSection{uni-rep-design-requirements}

As discussed in \refChapter{existing-isel-techniques-and-reps}, in order to
address the limitations of existing approaches we need a \gls{constraint model}
capable of capturing the problems described in \refChapter{introduction}.
%
To this end, we need a \gls{graph}-based representation that fulfills the
following requirements:
%
\def\typesetReq#1{\emph{#1}}%
\begin{requirements}
  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-capture-data-control}
    \typesetReq{It must capture the data and control flow of an entire
      \gls{function}.}
    %
    This is needed for modeling \gls{global.is} \gls{instruction selection},
    which demands access to the entire \gls{function} under compilation.
    %
    This is also needed for uniform selection of data and control
    \glspl{instruction}, which requires that both data and control flow be
    captured in a single \gls{graph}.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-blocks}
    \typesetReq{\Glspl{block} must be explicitly represented as \glspl{node}.}
    %
    This is needed for \gls{pattern matching}, where we must not be allowed to
    match \glspl{pattern} whose control flow is inconsistent with the
    \gls{function graph}.
    %
    For example, assume that the \gls{pattern} is derived from a saturated
    addition \gls{instruction}.
    %
    Such a \gls{pattern} will consist of three \glspl{block}~$b_1$, $b_2$, and
    $b_3$, where $b_1$ represents the \gls{instruction}'s point of entry, $b_2$
    represents the part where clamping is performed, and $b_3$ represents the
    \gls{instruction}'s point of exit.
    %
    The control flow in this \gls{pattern} will be such that there are two
    conditional jumps from $b_1$ to either $b_2$ or $b_3$, and an unconditional
    jump from $b_2$ to $b_3$.
    %
    To be matched, part of the \gls{function graph} must exhibit the same
    control flow structure.
    %
    This is also useful for modeling \gls{global code motion} as each such
    \gls{node} will correspond to a \gls{variable} in the \gls{constraint
      model}.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-ops}
    \typesetReq{Data and control \glspl{operation} must be explicitly
      represented as \glspl{node}.}
    %
    This is to retain the notion of \gls{cover}[age] and to treat
    \glspl{instruction} uniformly regardless of whether they operate on data or
    control flow.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-values}
    \typesetReq{Values produced and used by the \glspl{operation} must be
      explicitly represented as \glspl{node}.}
    %
    This is useful for modeling \gls{global code motion} and \gls{data copying}
    as every such \gls{node} will introduce a \gls{variable} in the
    \gls{constraint model}.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-exactly-one-inbound-edge-for-values}
    \typesetReq{In a \gls{function graph}, every \gls{node} representing a
      value must have exactly one inbound \gls{data-flow edge}.}
    %
    This ensures that every value has exactly one \gls{match} defining that
    value, which is useful when modeling \gls{global code motion}.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-fixed-operations}
    \typesetReq{The \gls{block} in which a particular \gls{operation} in the
      \gls{function} is to be performed must not be fixed.}
    %
    Without this, \gls{global code motion} is not possible.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-preserve-semantics}
    \typesetReq{Data \glspl{operation} must not be placed in \glspl{block} that
      will break \gls{program} semantics.}
    %
    This is needed to ensure correctness when performing \gls{global code
      motion}.

  \item \labelRequirement{uni-rep-ssa}
    \typesetReq{The representation must be based on \gls{SSA}.}
    %
    This is needed in modeling \gls{global code motion} as it explicitly
    states which values must be defined in which \glspl{block} in order to
    preserve \gls{program} semantics.
    %
    This is also useful for practical reasons as most \glspl{IR} used in modern
    \glspl{compiler} are already based on \gls{SSA}.
\end{requirements}

While there exist many \gls{graph}-based representations (see
\cite{StanierWatson:2013} for a survey), most fulfill only some of the
requirements but not all.
%
Consequently, a new representation has to be designed.


\section{Program Representation}
\labelSection{uni-rep-program-rep}

The \gls{universal representation} is essentially a combination of two existing
representations -- the \gls{SSA graph} and the \gls{control-flow graph}%
%
\footnote{%
  A \gls!{control-flow graph} is a \gls{graph} where each \gls{node} represents
  a \gls{block} in the \gls{function} and each \gls{edge} represents a jump from
  one \gls{block} to another.
  %
  \Glspl{edge} representing conditional jumps are labeled with a Boolean
  value indicating under which conditions the jump is taken.
  %
  An example is given in \refFigure{function-example-cf-graph}.
}
%
-- which are extended to fulfill the missing requirements and then merged into a
single \gls{graph}.
%
This makes for a simple construction process as the \glsshort{control-flow
  graph} and \glspl{SSA graph} are already used inside principally all modern
\glspl{compiler}.


\paragraph{Capturing Control Flow}

We start with the \gls{control-flow graph}.
%
As it captures the control flow for an entire \gls{function},
\refRequirement{uni-rep-capture-data-control} is already partially fulfilled.
%
\refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-blocks} is also fulfilled since \glspl{block}
in the \gls{control-flow graph} are already represented as \glspl{node}, which
we call \glspl!{block node}.
%
In contexts where is no risk of confusion, the terms \emph{\glspl{block}} and
\emph{\glspl{block node}} can be used interchangeably.

To partially achieve \refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-ops}, we insert
\glspl!{control node} to represent \glspl{operation} that change the control
flow from on \gls{block} to another.
%
We also redirect the \glspl{edge} such that control flows through these
\glspl{node}.
%
For example, in the \gls{control-flow graph} shown in
\refFigure{function-example-cf-graph}, \glspl{control node} representing
unconditional branches are inserted along the \glspl{edge} between the
\irBlock*{entry} and \irBlock*{head} \glspl{node} and between the
\irBlock*{body} and \irBlock*{head} \glspl{node}.
%
\begin{filecontents*}{uf-example-ssa.c}
int factorial(int $\irVar{n}[1]$) {
  entry:
    int $\irVar{f}[1]$ = 1;
  head:
    int $\irVar{f}[2]$ = $\mPhi$($\irVar{f}[1]$:entry, $\irVar{f}[3]$:body);
    int $\irVar{n}[2]$ = $\mPhi$($\irVar{n}[1]$:entry, $\irVar{n}[3]$:body);
    bool b = $\irVar{n}[2]$ <= 1;
    if b goto end;
  body:
    int $\irVar{f}[3]$ = $\irVar{f}[2]$ * $\irVar{n}[2]$;
    int $\irVar{n}[3]$ = $\irVar{n}[2]$ - 1;
    goto head;
  end:
    return $\irVar{f}[2]$;
}
\end{filecontents*}%

For the conditional control flow originating from the \irBlock*{head}
\gls{block}, a \gls{control node} representing a conditional branch is inserted
and connected to the \irBlock*{head} \gls{node}, and the labeled \glspl{edge}
are redirected to the new \gls{node}.
%
Lastly, a \gls{control node} representing a \gls{function} return is inserted
and connected to the \irBlock*{end} \gls{node}.

            Example of a universal function graph, built from the \gls{function}

            Thick-lined diamonds, boxes, and arrows represent control nodes,
            block nodes, and control-flow edges, respectively.

  \labelFigure{uf-graph-example}
\end{figure}

An invariant here is that each \gls{control node} has exactly one \gls{edge}
flowing \emph{from} a \gls{block node}, and each \gls{block node} has exactly
one \gls{edge} flowing \emph{to} a \gls{control node}.
%
In other words, every control \gls{operation} belongs to exactly one
\gls{block}, and every \gls{block} has exactly one point where changes in
control occur.
%
This also means that the extended \gls{control-flow graph} forms a
\gls{bipartite.g} \gls{graph}, with \glspl{block node} on one end and
\glspl{control node} on the other.


\paragraph{Capturing Data Flow}

We continue with the \gls{SSA graph}.
%
As it captures the data flow for an entire \gls{function} and represents data
\glspl{operation} as \glspl{node} -- we call these \glspl!{computation node} --
the remaining parts of \refRequirement{uni-rep-capture-data-control} and
\refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-ops} are fulfilled.
%
\refRequirement{uni-rep-ssa} is inherently fulfilled as the \gls{SSA graph}
requires the \gls{function} to be in \gls{SSA}~form.

To achieve \refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-values}, we insert \glspl!{value
  node} to represent the entities produced and used by the data
\glspl{operation}.
%
We also redirect the \glspl{edge} in same fashion as when extending the
\gls{control-flow graph}.
%
\Glspl{node} representing \gls{function} returns are removed as these are
already represented in the extended \gls{control-flow graph}.
%
Using the \gls{SSA graph} shown in \refFigure{function-example-ssa-graph} as
example, this results in the \gls{graph} shown in
\refFigure{uf-graph-example-extended-ssa-graph}.

Note that at this point the invariant specified in
\refRequirement{uni-rep-exactly-one-inbound-edge-for-values} that every
\gls{value node} has exactly one inbound \gls{data-flow edge} is broken, but
this will be addressed shortly.


\paragraph{Combining The Graphs}

We now connect the two extended \glspl{graph} together.
%
First, \glspl{data-flow edge} are inserted to connect control \glspl{operation}
with the values used by these \glspl{operation}.
%
In the case of our running example, such \glspl{edge} are added from
values~\irVar*{b} and~\irVar*{f}[2] to the \irCode*{\irCondBrText} and
\irCode*{\irRetText} \glspl{operation}, respectively.

To achieve the invariant specified in
\refRequirement{uni-rep-exactly-one-inbound-edge-for-values}, \glspl{data-flow
  edge} are also inserted from the \glsshort{entry block} \gls{block node} to
each \gls{value node} representing constants and function arguments.
%
Intuitively, this means that such values are produced at the point of entry to
the \gls{function}.
%
Like with the extended \gls{control-flow graph}, the extended \gls{SSA graph}
also forms a \gls{bipartite.g} \gls{graph}, with \glspl{value node} on one end
and \glspl{computation node} on the other.

Since there are no \glspl{edge} connecting \glspl{computation node} with
\glspl{block node}, the assignment of data \glspl{operation} to \glspl{block} is
free, thus fulfilling \refRequirement{uni-rep-fixed-operations}.
%
This alone, however, permits \glspl{operation} to be moved to \glspl{block} that
will break \gls{program} semantics.
%
For example, assume the code snippet and corresponding, extended
\glsshort{control-flow graph} and \glspl{SSA graph} shown in
\refFigure{preserving-semantics-example}.
%
\begin{filecontents*}{preserving-semantics-code.c}
  $\ldots$
  int $\irVar{x}[1]$ = $\ldots$;
check:
  bool b = $\ldots$;
  if b goto dec;
inc:
  int $\irVar{x}[2]$ = $\irVar{x}[1]$ + 1;
  goto merge;
dec:
  int $\irVar{x}[3]$ = $\irVar{x}[1]$ - 1;
join:
  int $\irVar{x}[4]$ = $\mPhi$($\irVar{x}[2]$:inc, $\irVar{x}[3]$:dec);

  \labelFigure{preserving-semantics-example}
\end{figure}
%
In the original code, the addition should be performed in the \irBlock*{inc}
\gls{block} while the subtraction should be performed in the \irBlock*{dec}
\gls{block}.
%
But according to the \gls{graph}, swapping the placement of these
\glspl{operation} would be considered a valid move, which clearly results in a
different \gls{program}.
%
We recognize that such problems occur exactly in situations where a value is
expected to be produced in a particular \gls{block}, which are precisely the
\glspl{constraint} captured by the \glspl{phi-function}.
%
Consequently, for each value-\gls{block} pair \mbox{$\mPair{v\hspace{-1pt}}{b}$}
appearing as argument to a \gls{phi-function}, we add a \gls!{definition edge}
between the corresponding \glsshort{value node} and \gls{block node}.
%
This forces $v$ to be produced in~\mbox{$b$\hspace{-1pt},} which in turn
prevents the \gls{operation} producing $v$ from being moved out
of~\mbox{$b$\hspace{-1pt}.}
%
Hence \refRequirement{uni-rep-preserve-semantics} is achieved.

Lastly, for convenience we prevent \glspl{phi-function} from being moved by
inserting a \gls{definition edge} between the value produced by the
\gls{phi-function} and the \gls{block} wherein the \gls{phi-function} originally
resides in the \gls{function}.
%
This results in the \gls{graph} shown in
\refFigure{uf-graph-example-full-graph},\!%
%
\footnote{%
  In this case, the \glspl{definition edge} from the \irBlock*{entry} \gls{node}
  to the \irVar*{n}[1] and \irVar*{1} \glspl{node} are redundant since the
  \glspl{data-flow edge} are sufficient to force these values to be produced in
  the \irBlock*{entry} \gls{block}.
}
%
which is called \gls!{UF graph}.


\paragraph{Refining the Notion of Coverage}

Since new \glspl{node} have been introduced, we must refine the definition of
\gls{cover}[age] to apply for \glspl{UF graph}.
%
If an \gls!{operation} denotes either a \glsshort{computation node} or
\gls{control node} in a \gls{UF graph}~$G$, then a subset~\mbox{$M' \subseteq
  M$}, where $M$ is a \gls{match set}, \gls!{cover}[s] $G$ if every
\gls{operation} in $G$ appears in at least one match in~$M'$\!.
%
Similarly, \gls{exact.c} \gls{cover}[age] is also redefined as above.


\subsection{Representing Constants As Single Or Multiple Nodes}

Duplicated constants may either be represented using individual \glspl{value
  node} (as in \refFigure{uf-graph-example-full-graph}) or through a single
\gls{value node} (as in \refFigure{preserving-semantics-graph}).
%
The former is simpler from a \gls{code generation} perspective, but may result
in redundant \glspl{instruction} where the same constant is needlessly reloaded.
%
This can be avoided by using the latter together with a technique to be
described in \refSection{modeling-value-reuse} in the next chapter, but this
also requires the \gls{UF graph} to be transformed and extended with additional
\glspl{operation} in order to guarantee correctness.
%
For example, assume a \gls{function} containing two \glspl{phi-function}
\irCode*{\irPhi{$\ldots$, 1:\irBlock{a}, $\ldots$}} and
\irCode*{\irPhi{$\ldots$, 1:\irBlock{b}, $\ldots$}}.
%
If the constant~\irVar*{1} is represented using a single \gls{value node}, then
the \gls{value node} will have two \glspl{definition edge}, one from
\gls{block}~\irBlock*{a} and another from \gls{block}~\irBlock*{b}.
%
Since a value cannot be defined in two \gls{block} simultaneously, there exist
no \gls{solution} for this \gls{UF graph}.
%
This problem is fixed by applying \gls{copy extension}, which will be described
in \refChapter{constraint-model}.


\subsection{Data Types of Values}
\labelSection{uni-rep-data-types-of-values}

Both \glspl{program} and \glspl{instruction} expect their argument values to be
represented in a specific format.
%
For example, in integer arithmetic the values are typically represented using
signed or unsigned two's complement values of a certain width.
%
It is also common that the result is given using the same format as the argument
values.
%
As this could lead to overflow, mechanisms are often in place to detect such
occurrences.
%
However, if the selected \gls{instruction} produces results of wider bit width
than specified in the \gls{function graph}, the expected overflow may not occur.
%
Consequently, for both \glsshort{function graph} and \glspl{pattern graph} the
data type of a value is also specified in the corresponding \gls{value node}.
%
For integers this entails the value's bit width, and two values are compatible
if they have the same bit width.
%
\Glspl{value node} representing constants also have a value range, which is a
singleton for constants appearing in the \gls{UF graph}.
%
A constant~$c$ is compatible with another constant~$d$ if the value range of~$d$
is a subset of the value range of~$c$.
%
Note that this relation is not necessarily commutative.


\subsection{Common Subexpression Elimination}

Common subexpressions may appear as part of legalizing the \gls{function} before
passing it to the \gls{instruction selector}.
%
For example, in \gls{LLVM} there is an \gls{operation} called
\instrCode*{getelementptr} which takes care of computing the address when
accessing an array element or object field.
%
To construct the corresponding \gls{UF graph}, these \glspl{operation} first
need to be lowered into a series of additions and multiplications.
%
However, if two or more \instrCode*{getelementptr}s compute the same address
then these expressions will be duplicated, thus resulting in redundant
\glspl{instruction}.
%
Consequently, such common subexpressions should be eliminated after having
performed legalization but before constructing the \gls{UF graph}.


\subsection{Handling Implicit Dependencies}

The representation described thus far is sufficient for handling simple
\glspl{operation}, such as arithmetic computations.
%
Certain \Glspl{operation}, such as memory \glspl{operation} and function calls,
require additional \gls{graph} structures as they may implicitly depend on one
another.
%
Consequently, if these dependencies are not taken into account for \gls{global
  code motion}, then such \glspl{operation} can be moved in a way that breaks
\gls{program} semantics.

We capture implicit dependencies using \glspl!{state node}.
%
In addition to its normal value arguments, an \gls{operation} that may
implicitly depend on another \gls{operation} takes exactly one \gls{state node}
as input and produces another \gls{state node}.
%
Hence, if an \gls{operation}~$o_1$ implicitly depends on another
\gls{operation}~$o_2$, then $o_1$ takes as input the \gls{state node} produced
by $o_2$.
%
For each \gls{block} in the \gls{function}, a new \gls{state node} is created
and remembered as the last \gls{state node}.
%
When a \gls{computation node} with potential for implicit dependencies is
created, a \gls{state-flow edge} is also inserted from the last \gls{state node}
to the currently last \gls{state node}.
%
Afterwards a new \gls{state node} is created and set as last, and another
\gls{state-flow edge} is inserted from the \gls{computation node} to the
just-created \gls{state node}.
%
Once all \glspl{operation} in the \gls{block} has been processed, the first and
last \glspl{state node} are connected to the \gls{block node} through a
\gls{state-flow edge} and a \gls{definition edge}, respectively.
%
Because the first and the last \gls{state node} must both be defined within the
\gls{block}, this effectively forbids \glspl{operation} with implicit
dependencies from being moved out of the \gls{block}, which could break
\gls{program} semantics.
%
An example is shown in \refFigure{uni-rep-impl-dep-example}.
%
\begin{filecontents*}{impl-dep-example-ir.c}
block:
  $\ldots$
  store p, $\ldots$
  call foo, p

  \labelFigure{uni-rep-impl-dep-example}
\end{figure}

Note that, unlike with \glspl{value node}, the \gls{state-flow edge} must not be
drawn from the \glsshort{entry block} \gls{block node}.
%
Hence the same invariant for \glspl{value node} also apply for \glspl{state
  node}.


\subsection{Edge Numbers}

During \gls{graph} construction, every \gls{edge} is given two \glspl!{edge
  number} which allows the \glspl{edge} to be ordered \wrt to a given
\gls{node}.
%
This is needed for \gls{pattern matching}, which will be described in
\refSection{uni-rep-pattern-matching}.
%
For a given \gls{edge}~\mbox{$e = \mEdge{n_1}{n_2}$} of
type~\mbox{$t$\hspace{-1pt},} where $t$ represents either \glslong{control-flow
  edge}, \glslong{data-flow edge}, or \glslong{state-flow edge}, the
\gls!{inbound.en}[ \gls{edge number}], denoted \mbox{$\mInEdgeNr(e) =
  i$\hspace{-.8pt},} indicates that $e$ is the $i$th \gls{ingoing.e} \gls{edge}
of type~$t$ connected to~$n_2$.
%
Similarly, the \gls!{outbound.en}[ \gls{edge number}], denoted
\mbox{$\mOutEdgeNr(e) = i$\hspace{-.8pt},} indicates that $e$ is the $i$th
\gls{outgoing.e} \gls{edge} of type~$t$ connected to~$n_1$.
%
Consequently, all \glspl{edge} which are of the same type and have the same
\gls{source} \gls{node} must be given distinct \gls{outbound.en} \glspl{edge
  number} such that they form a contiguous sequence.
%
Similarly, the same also applies for the \gls{inbound.en} \glspl{edge number} of
all \glspl{edge} with the same type and \gls{target} \gls{node}.

An example is given in \refFigure{edge-numbers-example}.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering%
  \input{figures/universal-representation/edge-numbers-example-graph}

  \caption[Example of edge numbers]%
          {%
            Example of edge numbers.
            %
            The inbound and outbound edge numbers are attached to the edges'
            heads and tails, respectively%
          }%
  \labelFigure{edge-numbers-example}
\end{figure}
%
Note that the \glspl{definition edge} in the example are oriented and labeled
with the same \glspl{edge number} as the \glspl{data-flow edge} connected to the
same \gls{value node}.
%
This is to be able to identify which \gls{definition edge} belongs to which
\gls{data-flow edge} when there exist multiple such \glspl{edge}, which is
needed when performing \gls{copy extension} (to be described in
\refChapter{constraint-model}).
%
In terms of restricting the definition placements, however, the orientation of
the \glspl{definition edge} does not matter and is thus skipped in cases where
this information is not needed.


\section{Instruction Representation}
\labelSection{uni-rep-instr-rep}

Modeling \glspl{instruction} as \glspl{pattern} is identical to modeling
\glspl{function} with two exceptions.
%
First, the \gls{control-flow graph} becomes empty if the output is not dependent
on control flow.
%
Hence a \gls{pattern} has either none or exactly one \gls{entry block}.
%
Second, no additional \glspl{data-flow edge} are added for \glspl{value node}
representing constants and \gls{instruction} input.
%
In other words, the invariant specified in
\refRequirement{uni-rep-exactly-one-inbound-edge-for-values} that every
\gls{value node} has exactly one inbound \gls{data-flow edge} does not need to
(and should not) hold for such values.
%
This results in a \gls{graph} called \gls!{UP graph}, for which two examples are
given in \refFigure{up-graph-examples}.

\begin{filecontents*}{add-code.c}
int add(int $\irVar{s}$, int $\irVar{t}$) {
  entry:
    int $\irVar{d}$ = $\irVar{s}$ + $\irVar{t}$;
    return $\irVar{d}$;
}
\end{filecontents*}

\begin{filecontents*}{satadd-code.c}
int satadd(int $\irVar{s}$, int $\irVar{t}$) {
  entry:
    int $\irVar{d}[1]$ = $\irVar{s}$ + $\irVar{t}$;
    if ($\irVar{d}[1]$ > MAX) goto clamp;
  clamp:
    int $\irVar{d}[2]$ = MAX;
  end:
    int $\irVar{d}[3]$ = $\mPhi$($\irVar{d}[3]$:entry, $\irVar{d}[2]$:clamp);
    return $\irVar{d}[3]$;
}
\end{filecontents*}

  \caption{Example of universal pattern graphs}
  \labelFigure{up-graph-examples}
\end{figure}

For the \gls{Haskell} prototype used in the experiments, the \glspl{UP graph}
are generated from a proprietary \gls{machine description} format where the
behavior of each \gls{instruction} is captured as \gls{LLVM} \gls{IR} code.


\subsection{Covering $\mPhi$-Nodes}

Since covering of a \gls{UF graph} also includes the \glspl{node} representing
\glspl{phi-function} -- we call these \glspl!{phi-node}, which typically do not
correspond to any \gls{instruction} on the \gls{target machine} -- we need a
special \gls{pattern} for covering such \glspl{node}.
%
Consequently, we assume that the \gls{pattern set} always includes a
\gls!{phi-pattern}, which is illustrated in \refFigure{phi-pattern}.
%
\begin{figure}
  \centering%
  \input{figures/universal-representation/phi-pattern}

  \caption{The $\mPhi$-pattern}
  \labelFigure{phi-pattern}
\end{figure}
%
The \gls{phi-pattern} has a variable number of input values since a
\gls{phi-function} may take an arbitrary number of arguments.
%
In our experiments, it proved sufficient to duplicate the \gls{phi-pattern} for
\mbox{$k = 2, \ldots, 15$}.
%
A \gls{match} derived from a \gls{phi-pattern} is called a \gls!{phi-match},
which has zero cost and emits nothing if selected.


\section{Pattern Matching}
\labelSection{uni-rep-pattern-matching}

Because neither \glsshort{UF graph} nor \glspl{UP graph} are necessarily
tree-shaped, a \gls{subgraph isomorphism} algorithm is needed for performing
\gls{pattern matching}.
%
The prototype applies the \gls{VF2}~algorithm~\cite{CordellaEtAl:2001} due to
its simplicity and ease of implementation.\!%
%
\footnote{%
  In his dissertation, \textcite{McCreesh:2017} cautions against using \gls{VF2}
  after showing that, for a large body of problem instances, it exhibits
  considerably worse performance compared to two other \gls{subgraph
    isomorphism} algorithms (\gls!{LAD}~\cite{Solnon:2010} and
  \gls!{Glasgow}~\cite{McCreeshProsser:2015}).
  %
  In case of \gls{instruction selection}, however, the problem instances are
  typically small enough that the time to find all \glspl{match} is negligible
  compared to the time to solve the \gls{constraint model}.
}
%
The algorithm is described in detail in
\refChapter{existing-isel-techniques-and-reps} on
\refPageOfSection{ex-isel-rep-vf2-algorithm}.

To adapt it for the \gls{universal representation}, we need to customize the
semantic rules (see \refDefinition{pm-semantic-rules} on
\refPageOfDefinition{pm-semantic-rules}).
%
For two \glspl{node}~$n$ and~\mbox{$m$\hspace{-.8pt},} \mbox{$n \mVFTwoAttrCmp
  m$} holds if $n$ and $m$ are of the same type.
%
That is, the \glspl{node} must either be two \glspl{block node}, two
\glspl{computation node}, two \glspl{value node}, \etc*.
%
For \glspl{value node}, their data types must also be compatible (as described
in \refSection{uni-rep-data-types-of-values}).

The same applies for two \glspl{edge}~$e$ and~\mbox{$d$\hspace{-.8pt},} with the
additional condition that, for certain \glspl{node}, the order of compatible
\glspl{edge} must also match.
%
Consequently, in a \gls{match} where $e$ and $d$ are connected to \glspl{node}
representing non-commutative \glspl{operation} -- such as subtraction and
division, but also memory stores and function calls -- the \gls{inbound.en}
\glspl{edge number} of $e$ and $d$ must be identical.
%
This prevents the arguments of such \glspl{instruction} from being swapped,
which would obviously break \gls{program} semantics.
%
Similarly, in a \gls{match} where $e$ and $d$ are connected to \glspl{node} with
multiple outgoing \gls{edge} of the same type -- such as conditional jump
\glspl{operation} -- the \gls{outbound.en} \glspl{edge number} of $e$ and $d$
must be identical, thus preventing swapping of target labels.


\subsection{Matching SIMD Instructions Efficiently}

Although the \gls{VF2} algorithm supports matching of \glspl{pattern} derived
from \gls{disjoint-output.ic} \glspl{instruction}, doing so directly will result
in many redundant \glspl{match}.
%
For example, if a \gls{SIMD.i} \gls{pattern} consists of $k$ identical
\glspl{operation} and the function contains $n$ such \glspl{operation}, then
this \gls{pattern} alone will result in \mbox{$n! / (n - k)!$} \glspl{match}.
%
However, since all \gls{SIMD.i} \glspl{instruction} consist of disjoint
\glspl{pattern} that are symmetric to one another, the order in which the
\gls{pattern} \glspl{node} are mapped to \gls{function} \glspl{node} does not
matter.
%
Hence at most $\binom{n}{k}$ \glspl{match} should be produced.

To this end, instead of matching the full \gls{SIMD.i} \gls{pattern} over the
\gls{UF graph}, we do so only for one of the disjoint \glspl{subgraph} in the
\gls{pattern}.
%
After having found all \glspl{match} for the \gls{subgraph}, we then compute all
combinations of these \glspl{match} and construct for each combination a
\gls{match} of the full \gls{SIMD.i} \gls{pattern}.
%
We also ignore combinations that will lead to cyclic data dependencies by
applying a variant of the method to be described in
\refSection{forbidding-cyclic-data-dependencies} in the next chapter.

To further reduce the number of \glspl{match}, we remove all \gls{SIMD.i}
\glspl{match} where at least one of its arguments is a constant value.
%
This is because such values will typically always require the \gls{SIMD.i}
\gls{instruction} to be preceded by a copy \gls{instruction}, which would
typically nullify the benefit of the \gls{SIMD.i} \gls{instruction}.


\section{Comparison with Other Sea-of-Nodes IRs}
\labelSection{uni-rep-ir-comparison}

The \gls{UF graph} is similar to the \gls{Click-Paleczny graph} (compare for
example \refFigure{uf-graph-example-full-graph} on
\refPageOfFigure{uf-graph-example-full-graph} with
\refFigure{click-paleczny-graph-example} on
\refPageOfFigure{click-paleczny-graph-example}).
%
Both are combinations of \glsshort{control-flow graph} and \glspl{SSA graph},
they represent (some) of the control \glspl{operation} as \glspl{node}, and they
can restrict the placement of \glspl{operation} to \glspl{block} through
auxiliary edges.
%
However, the \gls{Click-Paleczny graph} does not completely fulfill
\refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-ops} as unconditional branches are not
represented as \glspl{node}, nor does it fulfill
\refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-values} or
\refRequirement{uni-rep-exactly-one-inbound-edge-for-values}.

\textcite{BraunEtAl:2011} introduced another graph-based \gls{IR}, called
\gls!{Firm}, that is based on the \gls{Click-Paleczny graph} and fulfills
\refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-ops}.
%
However, it does not fulfill \refRequirement{uni-rep-explicit-values} nor
\refRequirement{uni-rep-exactly-one-inbound-edge-for-values}.


\section{Summary}
\labelSection{uni-rep-summary}

In this chapter, we have introduced a novel graph-based representation, called
\gls{universal representation}, that models both data and control flow on a
global scope.
%
This means that entire \gls{function} can be captured as a single graph and that
complex \glspl{instruction}, with or without control flow, can be modeled as
\glspl{pattern}.
%
The \gls{universal representation} also provides enough freedom to move
computations from one \gls{block} to another without breaking \gls{program}
semantics.
%
These features jointly enable the problems of \gls{global.is} \gls{instruction
  selection}, \gls{global code motion}, and \gls{data copying} to be modeled as
a \gls{constraint model}, which is introduced in the next chapter.
