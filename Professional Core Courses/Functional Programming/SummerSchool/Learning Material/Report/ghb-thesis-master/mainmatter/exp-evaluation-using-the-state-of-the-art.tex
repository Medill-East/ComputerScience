\chapter[Experimental Evaluation Using the State of the Art]%
        {Experimental Evaluation\\ Using the State of the Art}
\labelChapter{exp-evaluation-using-the-state-of-the-art}

This chapter evaluates how \gls{universal instruction selection} compares
against a state-of-the-art \gls{compiler}.
%
This is done in \refSection{evaluation-unison-vs-llvm}.
%
Since the approach is able to leverage selection of \gls{SIMD.i}
\glspl{instruction}, we also evaluate this impact in
\refSection{evaluation-with-or-without-simds}.


\section{Unison \versus LLVM}
\labelSection{evaluation-unison-vs-llvm}

We evaluate the impact of the approach by comparing the cost (that is, the total
number of cycles, as described in \refChapter{constraint-model} on
\refPageOfSection{cm-objective-function}) of \glspl{solution} produced by the
approach with the \glspl{solution} produced by \mbox{\gls{LLVM} 3.8} -- a
state-of-the-art \gls{compiler}.


\paragraph{Setup}

When filtering, we remove all \glspl{function} that have fewer than
\num{50}~\gls{LLVM} \gls{IR} \glspl{instruction} and more than
\num{200}~\glspl{instruction}.
%
Anything smaller will most likely not show any gain using the approach, and
anything larger will lead to unreasonably long experiment runtimes.
%
This leaves a pool of \num{284}~\glspl{function} up to medium size, from which
we then draw \num{20}~samples.

To curb experiment runtimes, we apply a time limit of \SI{600}{\s} to the
\gls{constraint solver}.
%
For any given \gls{function}, the last \gls{solution} found is considered
optimal if and only if the \glsshort{constraint solver} has finished its
execution within the time limit.
%
When using an upper cost bound, we take the cost for the \gls{solution} computed
by \gls{LLVM} for the given \gls{function}.


\paragraph{Results}

\RefFigure{unison-vs-llvm-cycles-plot} shows the normalized \gls{solution}
costs, with \gls{LLVM} as \gls{baseline} and \gls{universal instruction
  selection} as \gls{subject}.

\end{figure}
%
The size of the \glspl{UF graph} range from \num{189} to
\num{1524}~\glspl{node}.
%
The costs range from
\printCycles{\UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesAvgMin} to
\printCycles{\UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesAvgMax}, with a maximum
coefficient of variation of
\num{\UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesCvMax}.
%
The solving times range from
\printSolvingTime{\UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupPrePlusSolvingTimeAvgMin}
to
\printSolvingTime{\UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupPrePlusSolvingTimeAvgMax}
with a \gls{CV} of
\num{\UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupPrePlusSolvingTimeCvMax}.
%
The \gls{GMI} is \printGMI{%
  \UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesRegularSpeedupGmean%
} with \gls{CI}~\printGMICI{%
  \UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesRegularSpeedupCiMin%
}{%
  \UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesRegularSpeedupCiMax%
}.

We see that \gls{universal instruction selection} produces \glspl{solution} with
significantly less cost than those produced by \gls{LLVM} (up to~\printZCNorm{%
  \UnisonVsLlvmHexagonFiveCyclesSpeedupCyclesZeroCenteredSpeedupMax%
} improvement).
%
This is predominantly due to the combination of \gls{global.is}
\gls{instruction selection}, \gls{global code motion}, and \gls{block ordering}.
%
In three cases (\cCode*{alloc\_save\_spac}, \cCode*{gp\_enumerate\_fi}, and
\cCode*{gpk\_open}), for example, the approach is able to reduce cost by lifting
computations, in particular constant loads, out of \glspl{block} with high
execution frequency into \glspl{block} with lower frequency.
%
In \cCode*{alloc\_save\_spac}, the approach is also able to move an addition and
memory \gls{operation} into the same \gls{block} and implement both using a
single auto-increment memory \gls{instruction}, whereas \gls{LLVM} must
implement these computations using two \glspl{instruction}.
%
Such improvements are only possible when integrating \gls{global.is}
\gls{instruction selection} with \gls{global code motion}.

In three other cases (\cCode*{jpeg\_read\_header}, \cCode*{gl\_TexImage3DEX},
and \cCode*{gl\_EnableClient}), the approach is able to reorder the
\glspl{block} to remove one to two jump \glspl{instruction}.
%
Such improvements are only possible when integrating \gls{global.is}
\gls{instruction selection} with \gls{block ordering}.


\paragraph{Conclusions}

From the results for these experiments, we conclude that \gls{universal
  instruction selection} generates code of equal or better quality compared to
the state of the art for up to medium-sized \glspl{function}.


\section{Impact of SIMD instructions}
\labelSection{evaluation-with-or-without-simds}

We evaluate the impact of selecting \gls{SIMD.i} \glspl{instruction}
by comparing the cost of \glspl{solution} produced from two \glspl{pattern set}
derived from \gls{Hexagon}:
%
\begin{patternList}
  \item \labelPattern{no-simd}
    one with no \gls{SIMD.i} \glspl{instruction}
  \item \labelPattern{with-simd}
    one with \num{2}- and \num{4}-way \cCode*{add}, \cCode*{sub}, \cCode*{and},
    and \cCode*{or} \glspl{instruction}
\end{patternList}.


\paragraph{Setup}

When filtering, we again all \glspl{function} that have fewer than
\num{50}~\gls{LLVM} \gls{IR} \glspl{instruction} and more than
\num{150}~\glspl{instruction}.
%
Anything smaller will most likely not have enough data parallelism for selection
of \gls{SIMD.i} \glspl{instruction}, and anything larger will lead to
unreasonably long experiment runtimes.
%
To increase the chance of data parallelism, we also remove all \glspl{function}
not containing at least two addition, subtraction, logical-and, or logical-or
\glspl{instruction}.
%
This leaves a pool of \num{221}~\glspl{function}, from which we then draw
\num{20}~samples.

In this experiment we do not apply an upper bound in this case as that may
prevent interesting \gls{solution} that make use of \gls{SIMD.i}
\gls{instruction}.
%
Note that no \gls{loop unrolling}%
%
\footnote{%
  \Gls!{loop unrolling} is the task of duplicating the body of a loop in order
  to increase data parallelism at the cost of increasing code size.%
}
%
is performed on any of the \glspl{function} prior to \gls{instruction
  selection}.


\paragraph{Results}

\RefFigure{simd-vs-without-cycles-plot} shows the normalized \gls{solution}
costs for the two \glspl{pattern set} describe above, with \gls{pattern
  set}~\refPattern{no-simd} as \gls{baseline} and \gls{pattern
  set}~\refPattern{with-simd} as \gls{subject}.

The costs range from

} with \gls{CI}~\printGMICI[round-precision=3]{%
  \SimdVsWithoutCyclesSpeedupCyclesRegularSpeedupCiMin%
}{%
  \SimdVsWithoutCyclesSpeedupCyclesRegularSpeedupCiMax%
}.

We see that the \gls{pattern set}~\refPattern{with-simd} yields \glspl{solution}
with significantly less cost than those yielded by \gls{pattern
  set}~\refPattern{no-simd} (up to~\printZCNorm{%
  \SimdVsWithoutCyclesSpeedupCyclesZeroCenteredSpeedupMax%
} improvement).
%
The five cases with less cost (\cCode*{debug\_print\_str},
\cCode*{gl\_read\_alpha\_s}, \cCode*{gx\_curve\_cursor}, \cCode*{mp\_dmul}, and
\cCode*{zero}), \gls{universal instruction selection} is able to combine pairs
of additions or subtractions into \num{2}-way \gls{SIMD.i} \glspl{instruction}.
%
In addition, in one of these cases (\cCode*{gl\_read\_alpha\_s}) the additions
originally reside in different \glspl{block}, but due to \gls{global code
  motion} the approach is able to move the computations to the same \gls{block}
and implement these using a single \gls{instruction}.


\paragraph{Conclusions}

From the results for these experiments, we conclude that there is sufficient
data parallelism to be exploited through selection of \gls{SIMD.i}
\glspl{instruction} without having to resort to \gls{loop unrolling}.
%
In addition, this exploitation benefits from \gls{global code motion} as that
allows computations to be gathered from different \glspl{block} and implemented
using a single \gls{SIMD.i} \gls{instruction}.
