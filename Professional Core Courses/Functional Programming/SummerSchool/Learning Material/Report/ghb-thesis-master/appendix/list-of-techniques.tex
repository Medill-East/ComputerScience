\chapter{List of Techniques}
\labelAppendix{list-of-techniques}

The list starts on the next page, with its legend appearing at the end of the
list.
%
The techniques are ordered chronologically.

Note that the capabilities of all techniques have been set to reflect those
exhibited by current implementation prototypes and known applications, not the
capabilities that could potentially be achieved through extensions of the
technique.
